# Etre_Worpress
Extends Fishpig's Magento WordPress module so that widgets and variables can be inserted into page/post content

1. First [install FishPig](http://fishpig.co.uk/magento/extensions/installation-guide/), this module depends on it.
  - It's recommended that you install WordPress in a subdirectory of your Magento website named "wp".
2. Move these files to the base installation directory of Magento.
  - If you installed WordPress to a directory other than "wp", be sure to move the Etre_Wordpress files within wp to the base directory of your WordPress installation.
3. Visit the Magento Connector settings within WordPress and add your Magento details.

Now you can automatically insert Magento widgets into WordPress pages or posts the same as you would from within Magento!

As an added feature, I've created a widget that allows users to dynamically insert links to author categories.
